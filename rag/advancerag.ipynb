Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples.

The design of the Transformer also improves results in a range of machine translation tasks, including those involving English-to-English and English-to-French translation, as demonstrated by experiments on the WMT 2014 task. In addition to its effectiveness at these tasks, the Transformer also achieves state-of-the-art results in a range of other machine translation tasks, including those involving German-to-English translation and constituency parsing with limited training data.
